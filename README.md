Cute or Boot?
This is a collaborative group project for DigitalCrafts February 2018 part-time Flex cohort students Brendan Strallow, Lillian Wakefield, and James Gottschalk. The premise is simple - the user loads the webpage and is able to vote on the cuter of the two images of dogs or cats. Or Both! Then, the images that are liked by the user are stored to the browser's local storage for viewing in the Gallery later.
Technology
The requirements for the project were laid out in the instruction document and the students chose to use the dog.ceo API for dog images and thecatapi.com API for the cat images. Git, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery are some of the technologies that the students utilized while working together to finish this project.
Index
The main homepage was designed and coded initially by Brendan Strallow. There are HTML and CSS elements mixed with Bootstrap checkboxes and cards. The cards incorporate buttons with click listeners to handle the voting of images.
Gallery
The gallery page was designed and coded by Lillian Wakefield. There are HTML and CSS elements on this page as well as Bootstrap cards to display the images voted as cutest by the user. There are buttons on the cards that delete the image if the user wishes to do so.
About
The about page was designed and coded by James Gottschalk. There are HTML and CSS elements with Bootstrap cards to display photos and information about the developers.
Organization
The team used Slack to communicate. Trello was used to organize thoughts and keep track of the flow of the project. Each developer utilized branching in Git and the others reviewed pull requests to keep the files and code in good shape.
